[1] What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git folder is added to whichever folder the repository was created in. It needs to be initialized for commits to be made, it does not exist beforehand.

[2] How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	It provides some sort of an intermediate state where files can be temporarily stored waiting to be committed.
